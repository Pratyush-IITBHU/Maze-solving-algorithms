#### **1. Project 1:** Maze-solving-algorithms
- Python code to compare various maze solving algorithms like A star, Dijkstra, BFS, DFS etc.

#### **2. Project 2:** Self-Balancing, Controllable 2 wheeled bot using LQR optimal controller
- Python code to constrict basic controllable self balancing two wheeled turtlebot. I have used LQR for stabilising and moving the bot. 
- Also used controlpy to get k for negative eigen-values for given matrix A,B,R,Q.
